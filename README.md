# Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software development. These patterns provide a framework for solving problems in an efficient and structured way, and are used in many areas of software engineering, including system design, software architecture, and object-oriented programming.

There are many different design patterns, each with its own purpose and application. Some of the most common patterns include the Factory pattern, Singleton pattern, Observer pattern, and Strategy pattern.

Each design pattern has its own structure and rules, but they all follow the SOLID design principle. This principle states that software should be designed in a way that is:

- Single responsibility: each object should have a single responsibility
- Open-closed: software should be open for extension and closed for modification
- Liskov substitution: objects should be substitutable for instances of their subtypes
- Interface segregation: clients should depend on specific interfaces rather than depending on general interfaces
- Dependency inversion: high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions

This repository contains examples of different design patterns implemented in various programming languages. Each example includes a brief description of the design pattern, followed by sample code demonstrating how that pattern can be implemented in a specific context.
